xsudo.sh is an X11 sudo wrapper. It is intended to do what GKsu, GKsudo,
kdesu and kdesudo does, but instead of being requiring GTK or Qt, all
xsudo.sh requires is OpenSSH to be installed.

The script is written to be fully Bourne shell compatible.


INSTALLATION

Check the first section of the script for any configuration values you
need to adapt to your system. Also check that ssh-askpass in installed.

You are recommended to install the script in a location and with such
permissions that only root is allowed to modify it. This should do:

    $ sudo install xsudo.sh /usr/opt/bin


USAGE

   $ xsudo.sh [-t] [-u user] <command>'

Grants access for <user> to DISPLAY and uses sudo to run <command>
as that user.

    -t
        Use a trusted MIT cookie instead of an untrusted. This enables
        X11 extensions, which on the one hand enables accelerated
        graphics and unbreaks the ISO_Level3_Shift (Alt Gr) modifier,
        but on the other hand allows the invoked command to access every
        X11 event, essentially obliterating inter-program security.

    -u <user>
        Use sudo to impersonate <user> instead of the super-user.
        If the specified user does not exist, xsudo.sh exits with 1.
